Accenture and GE Aviation asked PS212 to assist in the definition, development, and launch of this joint venture which is dedicated to providing airlines and cargo carriers with the tools needed to predict, prevent, and recover from operational disruptions.

Our team lead a comprehensive branding effort which included the development of the corporate name, Taleris, and product name, Intelligent Operations. In addition, our team created the JV’s visual identity and implemented the system across important print and digital points of touch.​
