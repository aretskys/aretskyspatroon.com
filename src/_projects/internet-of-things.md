      BNY Mellon embarked on the digitization of their organization to offer greater efficiencies and learn from the data being generated by the bank’s millions of daily transactions.

      BNY Mellon’s executive team asked PS212 to assess the need for supporting language including unregistered brand names to help the organization tell a simple, consistent story internally and externally.

      Our team recognized an opportunity to leverage a familiar set of terms and to coin a term that drives insights. The final name, Digital Pulse, serves as an ingredient brand to the NEXEN platform.​
