KPMG’s Government Services division developed a solution that aggregates state and local government civil services on a single platform with a single point of entry for users. The offering was ground breaking and warranted a thoughtful brand and launch campaign.

Partners reached out to PS212 to clearly define the solution, develop a name, visualize the complicated story, and create a visual identifier. The team recommended KRIS (KPMG Resource Integration System) to be paired with the existing, KERA (KPMG Exchange Reference Architecture).

Members of the KPMG team expanded the scope by asking PS212 to develop visual identities for the both offerings.​
