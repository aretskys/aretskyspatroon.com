PS212’s naming work across every division of GE reflected a specific style and logic that GE’s Corporate brand team wanted to capture and communicate across the organization. To that end, GE’s corporate team asked PS212 to evaluate the company’s existing naming policies, guidelines, and tools.

As part of the process, our team established the role of naming at GE, what to name, how to name, and with what tools. In addition to simplifying the previous guideline document from 48 pages down to nine, our team developed a naming toolkit complete with a supporting video series and decision trees.​
