The digitization of financial services has brought dramatic change to some of the world’s oldest institutions. BNY Mellon, the world’s largest deposit bank with nearly $30 trillion dollars in assets, embraced a company-wide effort to enable, manage, and monitor all of the organization’s transactions.

BNY Mellon asked PS212 to assess the digitization effort from a brand perspective. The program included the articulation or positioning of the technology platform, a registered brand name, and supporting language to help BNY Mellon tell a consistent, accurate story about this investment.

The final name, NEXEN, is a coined term with the appropriate look, sound, and meaning. The name is a compound of familiar English words NEXt generation ENgine.​
